# MIT6.S081_2022_Lab

This is my repo on MIT's undergrad intro os engineering course's LAB.

Basically adding different utilities to XV6, a unix-based OS.

Some are verrrrry difficult (to me personally).

# The main branch is empty, checkout branches to see my work on the corresponding lab

Check out the git log to see how much hair I have lost and how much despair I have encountered.



## Not finished:
the copy on write lab. (redo it sometime later...)

part of the first util lab (primes, xargs)

Networking lab and beyond.

Note: the util branch is empty,

the work for the first util assignment can be found in the syscall branch.

(kinda forget to commit back then, long sad story about switching the working environment to Debian Server because GDB is no-existent on M1 Mac...)
